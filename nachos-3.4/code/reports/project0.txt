Report

a. Nachos Installation experience:
	As a team we where able to successfully install Nachos with only a few issues. For one getting 	the compressed file to ocelot.aul.fiu.edu was a bit of 	      a hurdle since the ftp server is not listed on the project setup. In addition an adjustment to the make-file in the test folder was necessary if the 
	nacho3.4/ folder is not in located in the home directory.

b. Testing Experience:
	All the test ran successfully and displayed the correct data after the installation was completed. The messages displayed when running the test were 
	helpful since debugging errors should be facilitated by the statistics displayed at each run.

c. Thread Class:
	The Thread class in Nachos represents a single thread of execution, providing options to temporarily yield CPU time to a waiting thread, sleep (stay 
	idle for a finite amount of time), finish, and identify the thread's currently status (just created, running, ready to run, and blocked). It maintains 	      a fixed stack size and the state of all the CPU registers. If the "User 	Program" module is set, the thread has its own address space and maintains 
	an additional set of CPU registers, to distinguish between the state of kernel versus user code. Lastly, there is a global function that performs the 	      actual context switching from one executing thread to another.

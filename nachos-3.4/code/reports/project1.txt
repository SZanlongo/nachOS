Running Exercises:
The threads/Makefile DEFINES must have the flags set: -DCHANGED and:
-DTHREADS
-DHW1_SEMAPHORES
-DHW1_LOCKS
-DHW1_Elevator

Exercise 1: Simple Threads Programming
When the threads are synchronized using semaphores to protect the "critical
section" of modifying SharedValue, each thread loops 5 times, resulting in the
SharedVariable finally reaching 5n (the correct value).

Exercise 2: Implementing Locks
Replacing the Semaphores with Locks in Exercise 1, we can still run it
successfully; the locks are held by one thread at a time, and record which
thread is using the Lock, once a thread acquires a Lock (using Acquire()),
only that thread can release (Release())it. 

Exercise 3: Implementing Conditions
We were able to successfully implement all of the Condition methods using code
similar to what was provided with the Semaphore implementation, most notably
storing Thread references in a queue and making use of the Lock class.

Exercise 4: Elevator
Implemented required fuctions in main.cc elevator.h elevator.cc
